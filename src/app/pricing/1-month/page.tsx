    q: "What happens when my 1-month subscription expires?",
    a: "You'll receive a reminder before expiry. Simply place a new order to renew — or upgrade to the 6-month or 12-month plan for better savings. There are no automatic charges and no contracts.",

    q: "How do I get support if something stops working?",
    a: "Our Canadian support team is available 24/7 via WhatsApp (+1 782-802-6280) and email in English and French. Most issues are resolved within minutes.",
